 Observation: Top predictions: Recon-HostDiscovery: 1.0000, Recon-PortScan: 0.0000, DDoS-UDP_Flood: 0.0000I have obtained the classification results from all the classifiers. Here are the predictions:

1. **Random Forest**: 
   - BenignTraffic: 0.5800
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 0.3500
   - MITM-ArpSpoofing: 0.0400

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors**: 
   - BenignTraffic: 0.6000
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 0.4000
   - DDoS-UDP_Flood: 0.0000

3. **Logistic Regression**: 
   - BenignTraffic: 0.5506
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 0.2117
   - MITM-ArpSpoofing: 0.1107

4. **MLP**:

   - MITM-ArpSpoofing: 0.0832
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 0.0587

5. **Support Vector Classifier**: 
   - BenignTraffic: 0.6333
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 0.2332
   - MITM-ArpSpoofing: 0.0856

6. **Decision Tree**: 
   - Recon-HostDiscovery: 1.0000
   - Recon-PortScan: 0.0000
   - DDoS-UDP_Flood: 0.0000

Now, I will summarize the results. The majority of the classifiers predict "BenignTraffic" or "Recon-HostDiscovery" as the top labels. However, the Decision Tree model strongly predicts "Recon-HostDiscovery" with a confidence of 1.0000.

To resolve the discrepancies, I will search for more information about "Recon-HostDiscovery" to understand its characteristics and how it can be detected using traffic features.
