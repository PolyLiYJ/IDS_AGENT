The difference between Recon-PortScan and DoS-SYN_Flood lies in their objectives, behavior, and impact on the network:

1. Recon-PortScan:
Objective: The goal of a Recon-PortScan is to gather information about a target system. Attackers use port scanning techniques to probe a network or system to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. This is typically done as a precursor to further attacks.
Behavior:
Low-volume traffic that involves sending requests to multiple ports on a target system to determine which ones are open.
Small packet sizes and interactions with a wide range of ports, typically focusing on lower port numbers (1-1024).
No direct disruption to the system occurs during the scanning process; it is more of a reconnaissance activity aimed at gathering intelligence.
Impact:
It is a passive attack and usually does not disrupt the services on the target system. However, it is often a precursor to active attacks such as exploiting vulnerabilities discovered during the scan.
2. DoS-SYN_Flood:
Objective: The aim of a DoS-SYN_Flood is to disrupt the target system or network by overwhelming it with a flood of incomplete connection requests. This type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack seeks to exhaust the system's resources, rendering it unable to handle legitimate requests.
Behavior:
A high-volume traffic attack where the attacker sends numerous SYN (synchronize) requests to the target system but does not complete the TCP handshake by sending the corresponding ACK (acknowledge) messages.
The target system allocates resources to handle each incoming connection request, and as the number of incomplete requests grows, the system's resources are depleted.
Primarily focuses on one or a few ports on the target system, typically TCP ports.
Impact:
It is an active attack designed to make the system or service unavailable to legitimate users by overloading the target with traffic.
Can cause significant disruptions to network services, making the target system unresponsive or slow to process legitimate traffic.
Summary of Differences:
Recon-PortScan is focused on information gathering and is usually passive, while DoS-SYN_Flood is a disruptive attack aimed at causing service downtime.
Recon-PortScan scans multiple ports to identify vulnerabilities, whereas DoS-SYN_Flood targets one or a few ports with high-volume traffic to overload the system.
Recon-PortScan is part of the reconnaissance phase in the attack lifecycle, while DoS-SYN_Flood is an attack that directly impacts the availability of a service or system.
