Distinguishing these attacks (like Host Discovery, Ping Sweep, OS Scan, Vulnerability Scans, DDoS attacks, etc.) using IDS features requires the ability to analyze network traffic patterns, anomalies, and specific behaviors that each type of attack exhibits. Here’s how you can differentiate these attacks based on various **IDS features**:

### 1. **Host Discovery (Active/Passive Scanning)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **ICMP Echo Requests (Ping)**: A high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (ping requests) directed at multiple IP addresses.
* **TCP SYN/ACK Packets**: Scanning tools like Nmap may generate SYN/ACK packets to discover live hosts.
* **ARP Requests**: A large number of ARP requests may indicate an active attempt to discover devices on the network.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* Look for abnormal spikes in ARP or ICMP traffic.
* Detecting **synscan** or **ping sweep** patterns, where many hosts are probed within a short time.
* **Statistical Profiling**: This can identify anomalous discovery activities such as scanning large IP ranges or unusual protocols.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect a large number of pings (ICMP Echo Requests) within a short time.

  ```
  alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Sweep"; itype:8; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 20, seconds 2; sid:1000001;)
  ```

### 2. **Ping Sweep (ICMP Flood)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **ICMP Echo Requests (Ping)**: A large number of ICMP requests targeted at multiple destinations.
* **Destination Unreachable**: Many ICMP Destination Unreachable messages from a host being overwhelmed by pings.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Threshold-based Detection**: Monitor if a host or subnet receives a high number of ICMP requests in a short time.
* **Traffic Analysis**: Look for large numbers of ICMP Echo Requests directed at different destinations, usually within seconds.
* **Signature-based Detection**: IDS can compare packets against known patterns like ICMP ping sweeps.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect an ICMP sweep where a large number of ICMP requests are sent to various destinations.

  ```
  alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"Ping Sweep"; itype:8; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 30, seconds 3; sid:1000002;)
  ```

### 3. **OS Scan (OS Fingerprinting)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **TCP/IP Stack Analysis**: OS scan tools like Nmap and Xprobe attempt to fingerprint OS by analyzing subtle differences in responses from TCP/IP stacks.
* **Unusual TCP/UDP Responses**: Responses from hosts that don’t match typical behavior (e.g., varying TTL values, window size, or TCP options).
* **Probing Ports**: A scan on various ports that doesn’t seem consistent with normal application traffic.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Port Scanning Detection**: IDS can identify unusual access patterns to multiple ports, indicative of OS fingerprinting tools.
* **TCP/IP Stack Analysis**: Detection of TTL (Time to Live), window size, or sequence numbers that are not typical for the operating system can be flagged.
* **Service Detection**: Fingerprinting can also involve sending specially crafted packets and observing responses.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect unusual or rare combinations of TCP flags or unusual TTL values that can indicate OS scanning.

  ```
  alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"OS Fingerprinting attempt"; flags: S; ttl: 64; sid:1000003;)
  ```

### 4. **Vulnerability Scan**

**Features to Look For:**

* **Repeated Requests on Same Ports**: Vulnerability scanners often probe the same ports repeatedly.
* **Unusual Service Requests**: Access to services or protocols not commonly used, such as SMB, SNMP, etc.
* **Specific Exploit Patterns**: Patterns of traffic that match known vulnerability scanners, like Nessus or OpenVAS.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Signature-based Detection**: Use signature-based IDS like Snort to detect known vulnerability scanners or abnormal request patterns.
* **Traffic Analysis**: If a particular service or port is scanned at irregular intervals or with rapid frequency, it may indicate vulnerability scanning.
* **Threshold Alerts**: Set thresholds to detect repeated scanning or access attempts to the same service in a short time window.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect repeated access to a specific port within a set time.

  ```
  alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Vulnerability Scan on HTTP Port"; flags: S; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 10, seconds 3; sid:1000004;)
  ```

---

### 5. **Port Scan**

**Features to Look For:**

* **Multiple SYN Requests**: Port scanners often send a series of SYN packets to various ports on the target system.
* **Unusual Port Probing**: Scanning for a wide range of ports that are rarely accessed.
* **Stealth Scanning**: SYN, FIN, or NULL scans where packets have specific flags set to evade detection.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Port Scanning Detection**: IDS can flag a large number of connection attempts to different ports from a single IP within a short period.
* **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Detecting traffic patterns that are out of the ordinary, like an unusually high number of connection attempts to non-standard ports.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect a SYN scan targeting multiple ports within a short time.

  ```
  alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Port scan detected"; flags: S; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 20, seconds 3; sid:1000005;)
  ```

### 6. **ICMP Flood (DDoS)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **Massive ICMP Requests**: A DDoS attack might generate a flood of ICMP packets, overwhelming the network or server.
* **High Throughput from Multiple Sources**: Distributed ICMP floods (DDoS) will have large numbers of packets from multiple IP addresses.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Traffic Volume Monitoring**: IDS can monitor the volume of incoming traffic to detect large bursts of ICMP traffic.
* **Anomaly Detection**: A sudden surge in ICMP packets can indicate an ongoing flood attack.
* **Signature-Based Detection**: IDS systems can use signatures to detect flood patterns associated with DDoS attacks.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect an ICMP flood where a large number of packets are received.

  ```
  alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Flood"; itype:8; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 500, seconds 1; sid:1000006;)
  ```

### 7. **Slowloris (DDoS)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **Slow HTTP Requests**: The Slowloris attack keeps connections open by sending partial HTTP requests and waiting for a response, which exhausts server resources.
* **Unusual Request Behavior**: The attack involves incomplete HTTP headers that linger open for a long time.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Behavioral Analysis**: IDS can detect connections that remain open without completing the usual request-response cycle.
* **Threshold for Open Connections**: IDS can track unusually long open connections with incomplete requests.
* **HTTP Request Monitoring**: Monitor requests for incomplete or unusual HTTP headers.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect incomplete HTTP request patterns with long connection durations.

  ```
  alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Slowloris HTTP DoS"; content:"GET"; pcre:"/GET \/ HTTP\/1\.1\r\nConnection: keep-alive/"; sid:1000007;)
  ```

---

### 8. **SYN Flood (DDoS)**

**Features to Look For:**

* **SYN Packets without ACK**: SYN flood attacks often involve sending a high volume of SYN packets without completing the three-way handshake.
* **Flooding a Server's Connection Table**: A high rate of SYN packets directed at a server, causing it to consume excessive resources.

**IDS Detection Techniques:**

* **Traffic Flow Analysis**: IDS can identify unusual SYN packet activity, especially if the connection request never completes the handshake.
* **Rate-based Detection**: Monitor the rate of SYN packets and set thresholds to detect floods.

**IDS Rule Example**:

* **Snort Rule**: Detect a SYN flood by analyzing traffic that doesn't complete the handshake.

  ```
  alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"SYN Flood Detected"; flags: S; threshold:type threshold, track by_dst, count 100, seconds 5; sid:1000008;)
  ```

---

By setting thresholds for **packet rates**, **connections per time**, **abnormal port activity**, and **anomalous protocol patterns**, you can fine-tune your IDS to identify these attack types effectively. You’ll


also want to continuously update the IDS knowledge base with attack signatures based on ongoing threats and emerging attack patterns.
