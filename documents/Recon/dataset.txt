Army Cyber Institute (ACI) Internet of Things (IoT) Network Traffic Dataset 2023

Our primary objective is to introduce a novel dataset tailored for machine learning (ML) applications in the realm of IoT network security. This effort focuses on delivering a distinctive and realistic dataset designed to train and evaluate ML models for IoT network environments. By addressing a gap in existing resources, this dataset aims to propel advancements in ML-based solutions, ultimately fortifying the security of IoT operations.

ACI IoTRL Experimentation Setup

Our experimentation took place within the Internet of Things Research Lab (IoTRL) at the Army Cyber Institute (ACI), meticulously designed to emulate a realistic home environment. The IoTRL replicates the conditions of a typical home IoT network, encompassing a diverse array of both wired and wirelessly connected devices. This heterogeneous mix includes various IoT devices and regular networked devices commonly found in home environments.

To streamline the control and management of IoT devices, we seamlessly integrated Home Assistant within our lab. Home Assistant is a free and open-source software for home automation, designed to be a central control system for smart home devices. We use the platform to orchestrate interactions and automations among the diverse range of devices within our network.
For data collection, we strategically deployed network sniffers and monitoring points throughout the lab to capture both wired and wireless network traffic. This lab setup aims to create a realistic and dynamic environment, simulating the conditions of a home network with diverse IoT devices, enabling us to conduct experiments that closely mirror real-world scenarios.
