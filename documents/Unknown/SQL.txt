Based on the traffic data and your statement that this is an SQL Injection, let's break down the specific characteristics that could align with SQL Injection attacks:

Characteristics of SQL Injection:
Flow Duration and Traffic Volume:

SQL Injection attacks often involve short-duration connections (like the flow duration here: 186.35 ms) as the attacker attempts to execute malicious queries and quickly disconnect.
The relatively low traffic volume (736.2 bytes total) and the small number of packets (5.5 packets) could indicate that only a few payloads (such as malicious SQL queries) were sent, which is consistent with SQL Injection attacks, where the attacker is trying to trigger specific responses from the database server.
High Reset (RST) Count:

A high RST count (42.6) could indicate that the server is terminating the connection repeatedly after detecting potentially malicious input. SQL Injection attempts can cause errors or failures in the application, leading to frequent connection resets by the server when it encounters unexpected or malformed SQL queries.
No Common Application-Layer Protocols:

While SQL Injection usually happens over web applications (HTTP/HTTPS), the absence of HTTP or HTTPS in this flow might suggest that SQL Injection is happening through another interface (e.g., a backend service or an API that directly interacts with a database).
Short Inter-arrival Time (IAT):

The very short IAT of 0.0272 ms indicates rapid transmission of packets, possibly the result of an automated script attempting to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities by sending SQL payloads quickly to the server. Attackers often use automated tools like SQLMap to attempt various SQL Injection techniques, and these tools send requests at high speeds.
Reset Behavior and Low SYN Count:

The low SYN count (0.2) and high ACK flag combined with high RST values suggest that the attacker was able to establish partial connections, but the server reset them due to suspected malicious activity or query failure. SQL Injection can result in SQL errors or unexpected outputs that lead to resets.
Absence of Standard SQL Injection Patterns:

While we cannot see the actual payloads here (since this is just flow data), SQL Injection attacks often involve sending SQL keywords such as SELECT, UNION, DROP, or conditional logic like ' OR 1=1 --. These keywords may not appear directly in the flow data but can be inferred by patterns of short connections and resets as the server detects or blocks SQL-related exploits.
SQL Injection Flow Characteristics:
Automated tools used for SQL Injection can rapidly send malformed SQL queries, often resulting in quick termination of connections (high RST).
The attacker may attempt different SQL payloads, causing errors in the database server, which leads to frequent resets.
SQL Injection attacks typically involve sending small queries (as seen with the low traffic volume), attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's database handling.
What To Look For:
To confirm SQL Injection attacks, packet inspection would reveal actual payloads containing SQL query attempts, such as:

SQL keywords like SELECT, DROP, INSERT, or UPDATE.
Use of ' OR 1=1 -- or similar payloads designed to bypass authentication or extract data.
Error responses from the database indicating improper SQL syntax or logic, which could trigger resets in the server.
Conclusion:
Given the high reset count, low number of packets, and fast inter-arrival times, this traffic is consistent with SQL Injection attacks. These attacks often attempt to quickly send SQL queries to exploit a vulnerability, and the reset behavior might indicate failure or detection by the server.

If this is SQL Injection traffic, inspecting the payloads or using SQL Injection detection tools (such as web application firewalls) could help in confirming the exact nature of the attack.
