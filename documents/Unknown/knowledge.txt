Traffic features indicating potential unknown attacks such as DNS-Spoofing, VulnerabilityScan, DictionaryBruteForce, BrowserHijacking, SqlInjection, and CommandInjection are typically characterized by abnormal patterns in network activity. Below are some of the key traffic features that can suggest the presence of these types of attacks.

1. DNS Spoofing (DNS Cache Poisoning)
DNS spoofing involves falsifying DNS responses to redirect traffic. Features that indicate DNS Spoofing include:

Abnormal DNS Query/Response Patterns: Unexpected queries or responses for known domains, especially those with mismatched IP addresses.
Unusual DNS TTL (Time-to-Live) Values: Significantly lower or irregular TTL values can indicate tampering with DNS records.
High DNS Traffic Volume: A sudden spike in DNS traffic may be indicative of an ongoing spoofing attempt.
Mismatch between DNS Request and Response IPs: Legitimate DNS requests getting responses with spoofed IP addresses.
2. Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is often conducted by attackers to identify weaknesses in a system. Features include:

High Frequency of SYN Requests: Excessive SYN packets may indicate port scanning.
Unusual TCP/IP Flags: Non-standard combinations of TCP flags, such as FIN, URG, or PSH, may signal reconnaissance.
Connection Attempts on Unusual Ports: Connections to ports that are generally unused or unexpected (e.g., port 8080, 8443).
Requests for Known Vulnerabilities: HTTP requests targeting paths like /phpmyadmin/, /wp-admin/, or /server-status can indicate probing for known vulnerabilities.
3. Dictionary Brute Force
This attack involves systematically trying combinations of usernames and passwords. Typical features are:

Multiple Failed Login Attempts: High frequency of failed authentication attempts in a short period.
Login Requests from Unrecognized IP Addresses: Repeated login attempts from IPs not previously associated with the system.
Unusually Short Time Between Login Attempts: Rapid login attempts without delays, suggesting automated attack scripts.
Abnormal User-Agent Strings: Login requests using non-standard or spoofed User-Agent strings to mimic browsers or legitimate applications.
4. Browser Hijacking
This attack manipulates browser settings or redirects traffic to malicious sites. Traffic features may include:

Unusual HTTP Redirects: A sudden increase in HTTP 3xx redirect responses, especially those leading to unfamiliar or suspicious domains.
Unexpected JavaScript Downloads: Requests for downloading or executing JavaScript from non-standard or unknown servers.
Changes in Referrer Headers: HTTP requests with referrer headers that donâ€™t match expected navigation paths, indicating possible hijacking of web sessions.
Suspicious IFrames or Popups: Excessive use of IFrames in the HTML response, or script-based popup generation aimed at phishing or fraud.
5. SQL Injection
SQL Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Traffic features include:

SQL Keywords in URL/Parameters: HTTP requests containing terms like SELECT, UNION, INSERT, DROP, --, OR 1=1, etc., in URLs or parameters.
Abnormal POST Requests: POST requests containing query-like structures in fields where only data input is expected.
Inconsistent SQL Responses: Erratic HTTP response patterns from SQL errors or unusually long server processing times (suggesting a heavy SQL query).
Changes in Query Behavior: Request patterns triggering different SQL query structures, especially if the responses are manipulated or inconsistent.
6. Command Injection
Command Injection involves executing arbitrary commands on a server via a vulnerable application. Indicators include:

Unusual HTTP Request Patterns: URLs or request parameters containing shell metacharacters like ;, |, &&, $(), > which indicate attempts to execute commands.
Abnormal Execution Times: Requests resulting in longer-than-usual response times due to external commands being executed.
Unusual System Calls in Logs: Logs showing shell execution requests triggered by inputs that should normally not reach the system command layer.
Responses Containing System Output: HTTP responses that return command outputs like directory listings or system configurations.
General Features for Detecting Unknown Attacks:
For detecting previously unknown attacks, there are some generalized traffic features and techniques:

Anomaly Detection in Traffic Volumes: Sudden spikes or drops in traffic may indicate an ongoing attack.
Irregular Request Intervals: Attackers often use automated tools that create traffic with unnaturally consistent timing, as opposed to human-like random request intervals.
Network Flow Anomalies: Changes in flow patterns, such as a spike in outbound traffic from a normally quiet device, can indicate exfiltration or control communications.
Entropy of Packet Payloads: Attacks like DNS tunneling and data exfiltration through covert channels can increase the randomness (entropy) in packet payloads.
Advanced Techniques:
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Analyzing packet content (beyond headers) to detect malicious patterns or attack signatures.
Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection: Using unsupervised learning to identify deviations from normal traffic patterns that could signal unknown attack vectors.
If you need help implementing detection based on these features or setting up an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for identifying such attacks, let me know!
